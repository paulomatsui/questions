What is OOP?
--------------
Object-oriented programming is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Object-oriented programming takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 
The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, an exercise often known as data modeling. Once an object has been identified,  it is generalized as a class of objects which defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.
